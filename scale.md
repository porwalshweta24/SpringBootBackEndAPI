Scaling Considerations:

The current solution is suitable for a moderate number of users. To scale for increased traffic, considerations include optimizing API calls, enhancing error handling, and potentially introducing caching mechanisms.

The solution is designed to handle a gradual increase in users. To scale from 100 to 10,000,000 users per day, consider implementing later:

1. Load balancing for distributing incoming requests.
2. Database sharding or replication for improved read and write performance.
3. Caching mechanisms to reduce database load.
4. Asynchronous processing for resource-intensive tasks.
