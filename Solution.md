The /best-picture endpoint is designed to determine if a given movie has won the "Best Picture" Oscar. The solution leverages data from both the OMDB API and a CSV file containing Oscar awards information.

Key Design Decisions
Integration with OMDB API:

The solution fetches movie details from the OMDB API using the omdbService.fetchMovieByTitleFromApi method.
CSV Data Processing:

Oscar awards data is obtained from a CSV file through the oscarCsvService.readOscarDataFromCsv method.
Oscar Award Criteria:

The solution checks if the provided movie won the "Best Picture" Oscar based on the values in the "Won" and "Nominee" columns in the CSV data.
Error Handling:

The code includes basic error handling for potential exceptions during CSV data reading.

Example
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080//api/v1/movies/best-picture?title=TheMovieTitle&csvFilePath=/path/to/academy_awards.csv"

Replace TheMovieTitle with the actual title of the movie and /path/to/academy_awards.csv with the correct path to your CSV file.
